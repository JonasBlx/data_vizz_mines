Towards proactive agility of crisis response,"['accident management', 'decision making', 'emergency plans', 'hazards', 'risk assessment']",['IT [cs]'],"['The goal of this poster is to introduce the very first steps of a framework to support decision-making during the crisis response step of the crisis lifecycle. Indeed, crisis situations are unstable phenomena by nature and by the effects of the crisis response itself. So, the crisis response is challenged over time: new objectives, new risks, lack of resources, evolving weather conditions, etc. Reacting once events happened to adapt the response is not sufficient enough to provide the agility required by the decision-makers. Based on the projected effects of the chosen crisis response on a real-time model and several anticipated models of the situation, the proposed framework aims to achieve the last step of the situation awareness approach: the projection of the current situation in the near future. This can enable a proactive on-the-fly agility of the crisis response. The presented idea relies on the main results of the previous research work of two research teams on the agility of the crisis response (Barthe-Delanoë et al. 2018) and the transformation of raw data into a Common Operational Picture (COP) in a context of Big Data (Fertier et al. 2018). The aim is to combine these results to achieve the highest level of situational awareness by supporting proactive agility of the crisis response instead of reactive agility.']",2019/05/19,['A.

Optimisation models for the design of multiple self-consumption loops in semi-rural areas,"['optimization and control (math.oc)', 'fos: mathematics']",['IT [cs]'],"['Collective electricity self-consumption gains increasing interest in a context where localised consumption of energy is a lever of sustainable development. While easing energy distribution networks, collective self-consumption requires complementary prosumers' profiles. Before determining the proper energy exchanges happening between these prosumers, one must ensure their compatibility in the context of collective self-consumption. Motivated by real use cases from a solar power producer, this article proposes network flow-based linear models to solve both the design aspect of the problem and the attribution of distribution flows between the involved prosumers. Two main models are proposed, handling (i) single collective self-consumption loop creation and (ii) multiple loop creation. One of the objectives of this work is to provide models that can be applied at a strategic level which implies their extension to large time scale and large spatial scale. To do so, associated Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions are proposed to ensure model scalability along temporal and spatial dimensions. The proposed models are tested on realistic use cases to assess their performances.']",2024/10/17,['Yohann Chasseray'],"['Cluster 20', 'Cluster 16']",Cluster 20

Risk knowledge modeling for offer definition in customer-supplier relationships in Engineer-To-Order situations,"['customer-supplier relationship', 'offer definition', 'engineer to order', 'risk engineering', 'knowledge-based system', 'knowledge model']",['Engineering sciences [physics]'],"['This work deals with the customer-supplier relationship and concerns offer definition in Engineer-To-Order situations (ETO), by adopting the supplier point of view. In such cases, when the offer definition relies simply on key design choices without a detailed design, there is a specific risk (ETO-specific risk) that customer expectations cannot be fulfilled. This kind of risk is in addition to the conventional risks (non ETO-specific risk) involved in any delivery process (machine break down, resource not available, scrapped part…). In order to minimize the supplier risk of not being able to complete the offer as accepted and contracted by the customer, a knowledge-based system can be used to assist risk engineering. Consequently, this article proposes two interrelated knowledge modeling contributions. Firstly, a risk knowledge model which, when implemented in a knowledge-based system that supports risk characterization and risk treatment by using knowledge re-use techniques, is proposed and discussed. Secondly, two knowledge typologies for risk characterizations and treatments (both for ETO and non-ETO situations) in order to support risk knowledge, identification and modeling are also proposed and discussed. These contributions are innovative and groundbreaking in terms of both academics and applications: they provide a formal model to structure risk knowledge and a first list of risks and treatments to be taken into account in ETO and non ETO situations. After an introduction that presents the research gap, our objectives and an analysis of related works, our two contributions are described in two sections with respect to ISO31000 recommendations. The first section covers risk identification and evaluation while the second deals with risk treatments.']",2022,"['Delphine Guillon', 'Michel Aldanondo']","['Cluster 2', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 3', 'Cluster 6', 'Cluster 9', 'Cluster 9']",Cluster 9
A multicriteria Master Planning DSS for a sustainable humanitarian supply chain,"['disaster relief operations', 'humanitarian supply chain', 'sustainability', 'master planning', 'multi-objective decision support system', 'sustainable supply chain']",['Engineering sciences [physics]'],"['Humanitarian supply chains (HSCs) contribute significantly to achieving effective and rapid responses to natural and man-made disasters. Though humanitarian organizations have during the last decades made considerable efforts to improve the response to crises in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, HSCs are still faced with so many challenges, one of which is the incorporation of sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in the management of their supply chains. In the literature, some authors have highlighted that the planning and achievement of sustainability performance objectives in humanitarian operations is hindered by the lack of decision support systems (DSS). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective Master Planning DSS for managing sustainable HSCs. This Master Planning DSS includes: (1) the definition of a set of metrics for measuring the performance of a sustainable HSC; (2) an algorithm to solve the multi-objective problem; and (3) a Master Planning mathematical model to support the tactical planning of the sustainable HSC. Using the information gathered from field research and the literature, an illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the implementation and utility of the proposed DSS. The results show that the order in which the three sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) are prioritized has some impact on the performance measures. Therefore, it is important to fix a tolerance that would enable to obtain an acceptable balance (trade-off) between the three sustainability objectives, in line with the prioritization choice of the decision maker.']",2019,"['Laura Laguna Salvado', 'Matthieu Lauras']","['Cluster 15', 'Cluster 2', 'Cluster 14', 'Cluster 14', 'Cluster 8', 'Cluster 2']",Cluster 2
The Centralization and Sharing of Information for Improving a Resilient Approach Based on Decision-Making at a Local Home Health Care Center,"['home health care routing and scheduling problem', 'resilience', 'information sharing', 'discrete event simulation', 'optimization']",['Engineering sciences [physics]'],"['Home care centers face both an increase in demand and many variations during the execution of routes, compromising the routes initially planned; robust solutions are not effective enough, and it is necessary to move on to resilient approaches. We create a close-to-reality use case supported by interviews of staff at home health care centers, where caregivers are faced with unexpected events that compromise their initial route. We model, analyze, and compare two resilient approaches to deal with these disruptions: a distributed collaborative approach and a centralized collaborative approach, where we propose a centralization and sharing of information to improve local decision-making. The latter reduces the number of late arrivals by 11%, the total time of late arrival by 21%, and halves the number of routes exceeding the end of work time (contrary to the distributed collaborative approach due to the time wasted reaching colleagues). The use of a device, such as a smartphone application, to centralize and share information thus, allows better mutual assistance between caregivers. Moreover, we highlight several possible openings, like the coupling of simulation and optimization, to propose a more resilient approach.']",2023,"['Guillaume Dessevre', 'Cléa Martinez', 'Liwen Zhang']","['Cluster 11', 'Cluster 4', 'Cluster 12', 'Cluster 17', 'Cluster 20']",Cluster 11
A systematic approach to classify and characterize genomic islands driven by conjugative mobility using protein signatures,"['horizontal gene-transfer', 'transfer rna', 'elements', 'resistance', 'tn916']",['Engineering sciences [physics]'],"['Genomic islands (GIs) play a crucial role in the spread of antibiotic resistance, virulence factors and antiviral defense systems in a broad range of bacterial species. However, the characterization and classification of GIs are challenging due to their relatively small size and considerable genetic diversity. Predicting their intercellular mobility is of utmost importance in the context of the emerging crisis of multidrug resistance. Here, we propose a large-scale classification method to categorize GIs according to their mobility profile and, subsequently, analyze their gene cargo. We based our classification decision scheme on a collection of mobility protein motif definitions available in publicly accessible databases. Our results show that the size distribution of GI classes correlates with their respective structure and complexity. Self-transmissible GIs are usually the largest, except in Bacillota and Actinomycetota, accumulate antibiotic and phage resistance genes, and favour the use of a tyrosine recombinase to insert into a host's replicon. Non-mobilizable GIs tend to use a DDE transposase instead. Finally, although tRNA genes are more frequently targeted as insertion sites by GIs encoding a tyrosine recombinase, most GIs insert in a protein-encoding gene. This study is a stepping stone toward a better characterization of mobile GIs in bacterial genomes and their mechanism of mobility.']",2023,['Nicolas Cellier'],"['Cluster 16', 'Cluster 13', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 1']",Cluster 1

However, there are still some real-world challenges that have not been adequately considered. These challenges include environmental commitments and constraints related to the procurement of resources (as regards procurement commitment). This calls for the integration of the project planning and forward-reverse supply chain planning systems. To achieve this goal, this paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting a model that incorporates the two issues in the integrated planning system: (1) the procurement commitment objective is met through the just-in-time delivery of non-renewable resources to the project sites while considering the limited supply capacity of suppliers, and (2) the environmental commitment is satisfied by collecting and recycling the waste generated at project sites. A mixed-integer linear formulation of the problem is proposed. Since the model is NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial time-hard), the paper develops a new heuristic-based genetic algorithm to solve the problem instances. The main parameters of the algorithm are tuned using the Taguchi method. The results show the efficiency of the algorithm in obtaining appropriate solutions in reasonable computational times. The integrated planning model that is proposed in this paper and its novel resolution method would help managers to make more responsive and efficient decisions.']",2021,['Jacques Lamothe'],"['Cluster 11', 'Cluster 14', 'Cluster 20', 'Cluster 20', 'Cluster 3', 'Cluster 2']",Cluster 20

Design/methodology/approach A combination of a systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey of supply chain practitioners is applied. The interviews provide insights into supply chain practitioners' views of their approaches and, together with the solutions proposed in the literature, provide future recommendations for action for supply chain managers. Findings During the pandemic, companies experienced disruptions in supply, production and demand, as well as interruptions in transportation and distribution. The majority of the solutions proposed in the literature, coincide with the opinions of practitioners. These include collaborative risk management, real-time monitoring and information sharing, supply network management, scenario planning and “what-if” simulations. Research limitations/implications Although the number of interviews conducted and questionnaires completed is limited, they still serve to supplement the SLR with important practical insights and recommendations. Originality/value This paper presents a review of recent academic literature focusing on the impact of Covid-19 on supply chains and the existing solutions to mitigate that impact and manage future crises. It has been expanded to include industry perspectives and experiences. The findings of this study present recommended practices and strategies for better managing supply chains during a crisis.']",2022,"['Raphaël Oger', 'Matthieu Lauras', 'Jiayao Li']","['Cluster 1', 'Cluster 10', 'Cluster 2', 'Cluster 2', 'Cluster 15', 'Cluster 12']",Cluster 2

But the lack of tackling a very important obstacle, which is the difficulty of detecting and anticipating collaboration opportunities between enterprises, inspired this research.

Stable Heuristic Miner: applying statistical stability to discover the common patient pathways from location event logs,"['process mining', 'statistical stability', 'healthcare processes', 'patient pathways', 'indoor localization systems']",['Algorithm and data structure [cs.DS]].'],"['Purpose: The classic heuristic miner algorithm has received lots of attention in the healthcare sector for discovering patient pathways. The extraction of these pathways provides more transparency about patient activities. The previous versions of this algorithm receive an event log and discover several process models by using manually adjustable thresholds. Then, the expert is left with the difficult task of deciding which discovered model can serve as the descriptive reference process model. Such a decision is completely arbitrary and it has been seen as a major structural issue in the literature of process mining. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a new process discovery algorithm to facilitate patient pathways diagnosis.\r\nApproach:To address this scientific challenge, this paper proposes to consider the statistical stability phenomenon in an event log, and it introduces the stable heuristic miner algorithm as its contribution. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, a case study has been presented to monitor patient pathways in a medical consultation platform.\r\nOriginality:Thanks to this algorithm, the value of thresholds will be automatically calculated at the statistically stable limits. Hence, instead of several models, only one process model will be discovered. To the best of our knowledge, applying the statistical stability phenomenon in the context of process mining to discover a reference process model from location event logs has not been addressed before.\r\nFindings: Practical implications-The results enabled to remove the uncertainty to determine the threshold that represents the common patient pathways and consequently, leaving some room for potential diagnosis of the pathways.']",2022,"['Sina Namaki Araghi', 'Franck Fontanili', 'Elyes Lamine', 'Frederick Benaben']","['Cluster 8', 'Cluster 0', 'Cluster 10', 'Cluster 10', 'Cluster 7']",Cluster 10

The latter relies on a continuous environmental gradient that influences the landscape’s spatial configuration. 3. flsgen can generate fine-grained artificial landscapes in small amounts of time, which makes it suited to produce large landscape series systematically. We demonstrate the features of flsgen through three illustrative use cases. 4. flsgen is a practical and efficient tool that expand the current possibilities of neutral landscape models and widen their potential applications.

These methods offer visibility and comprehension out of complex and unstructured event logs. Over the past decade, the classic heuristic miner and applied heuristic-based process discovery algorithms showed promising results in revealing the hidden process patterns in information systems. One of the challenges related to such algorithms is the arbitrary selection of recorded behaviors in an event log. The offered filtering thresholds are manually adjustable, which could lead to the extraction of a non-optimal process model. This is also visible in commercial process mining solutions. Recently, the first version of the stable heuristic miner algorithm targeted this issue by evaluating the statistical stability of an event log. However, the previous version was limited to evaluating only activities’ behaviors. In this article, we’ll be evaluating the statistical stability of both activities and edges of a graph, which could be discovered from an event log. As a contribution, the stable heuristic miner 2 is introduced. Consequently, the definition of the descriptive reference process model has improved. The novel algorithm is evaluated by using two real-world event logs. These event logs are the familiar Sepsis data set and the urology department patients’ pathways event log, which is recorded by monitoring the interpreted location data of patients on hospital premises and is shared with the scientific community in this article.']",2024,"['Franck Fontanili', 'Elyes Lamine', 'Frederick Benaben']","['Cluster 8', 'Cluster 0', 'Cluster 9', 'Cluster 20']",Cluster 8

Therefore, we mitigate the issue by introducing cognitive process mining through the DIAG approach, which consists of a meta-model and an algorithm.

These transitions between layers are supported by a knowledge base embedding knowledge instances structured according to a crisis management metamodel. From a functional perspective, this platform is fully operational, however, to be able to cover any type of crisis situation, the knowledge base should be enriched, first, from a 'resource perspective' (to embed the various available means to deal with any faced situation), and second, from an 'issue perspective' (to understand all risks and damage that can appear on a crisis situation).

The evaluation of such systems, performing knowledge extraction using natural language processing methods requires performance indicators. The indicators usually used in such evaluations have limitations in the specific context of knowledge extraction for unsupervised ontology population. Thus, the definition of new evaluation methods becomes a need arising from the singularity of the harvested data, especially when these are not annotated.

The proposed evaluation method is based on the exploitation of data that serve as a reference but are not specifically linked to the data used for extraction, which makes it an original evaluation method.

To this end, we considered the project ”Cote Oublíee” started in 2016 by the environ-mental managers of the South Province of New Caledonia. It aims at delineating a complex reservesystem (including about 1200 km2 of terrestrial and 950 km2 of marine reserve) in the southeast of NewCaledonia in an area with rich biodiversity and overlapping with different socioeconomic interests (suchas 238 mining concessions, private and cultural lands, and fisheries) as well as 135 km2of area to berestored.

Relying on a constraint-based reserveselection model, we iteratively considered operational scenarios and produced maps providing the basisfor decision support.

Information is among the key life-supporting essentials in a disaster response, as well as water and basic foods which are vital to sustain lives. It is information technology these days that gives us access to most of this information. We rely greatly on it.

Successful information management will result in making higher situational awareness in a field that is crucial for a disaster response.

For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet. Simulation experiments of this model under the management of scenarios allows to identify the bus fleet size required.']",2019/12/08,"['François Marmier', 'Franck Fontanili']","['Cluster 8', 'Cluster 17', 'Cluster 13', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 1', 'Cluster 17', 'Cluster 13']",Cluster 17

Systematic conservation planning in New Caledonia: supporting sustainable land-use policies with reserve selection models,"['conservation', 'systematic conservation planning', 'new caledonia']","['Systematics, phylogeny and taxonomy', 'Ecosystems', 'Botany', 'Biodiversity and Ecology', 'Engineering sciences [physics]']","['Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and destruction are today the leading causes of species extinction on Earth. A major challenge for environmental managers, hence, is to efficiently balance land usebetween economic development and conservation of natural habitats. In New Caledonia, the smallestbiodiversity hotspot in the world, finding this trade-off is tedious. In particular, the conservation ofits highly diverse forest ecosystems, distinguished by high rates of endemism, can be conflicting withmining  activity, the major economic sector of  New Caledonia. Managers are willing to study howto refine decisional processes through the use of systematic conservation planning and computationalsustainability. To this end, we considered the project ”Cote Oublíee” started in 2016 by the environ-mental managers of the South Province of New Caledonia. It aims at delineating a complex reservesystem (including about 1200 km2 of terrestrial and 950 km2 of marine reserve) in the southeast of NewCaledonia in an area with rich biodiversity and overlapping with different socioeconomic interests (suchas 238 mining concessions, private and cultural lands, and fisheries) as well as 135 km2of area to berestored. Our objective was to identify how the reserve could be efficiently delineated while respecting socio economic constraints. More precisely, we focused on the biodiversity representation as much ason the spatial configuration of the reserve. Additionally, we aimed at reducing fragmentation throughthe identification of areas  suitable  for ecological restoration. Relying on a constraint-based reserveselection model, we iteratively considered operational scenarios and produced maps providing the basisfor decision support. The model was then refined according to a feedback loop between managers andscientists.  Through this iterative process, we could suggest a delineation of the reserve that maximizedthe representation of biodiversity features while satisfying managers constraints.  We also highlightedkey areas for reducing fragmentation through ecological restoration. This real-world pilot study showedhow systematic conservation planning can provide the basis of a decision support framework for conservation, through reserve selection models. Beyond that, it showed how the iterative use of such aframework could help to reduce the gap that can sometimes exist between scientists and managers.']",2019/07/08,['Xavier Lorca'],"['Cluster 14', 'Cluster 14', 'Cluster 1']",Cluster 14
Virtual Reality to Train for Crisis Management,"['virtual reality', 'crisis management', 'exercises', 'decision-support system']",['Engineering sciences [physics]'],"['The EGCERSIS project aims at using virtual reality to improve the efficiency of the crisis management preparation phase.

In this article, we demonstrate the idea of the project through a simple use-case taking place in a metro station and involving three crisis responders.

Scheduling and routing issues often require consideration of various businesses constraints under different industrial contexts, thereby ensuring the optimal use of resources. Decision-makers need customizable optimizers to specify business-oriented constraints and define their target planning generation needs. In our work, we present 'BL.Optim', an optimizer with two-stage model-based architecture, which aims at capturing routing and scheduling requirement for a wide category of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). We demonstrated our approach on Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problems (HHCRSP), Home Meal Delivery Problems and Preventive Maintenance Scheduling and Routing Problems. The captured requirements are customizable by activating the necessary constraints facing the different realistic use cases. A series of CSP-based activable soft constraints and non-violated hard constraints are embedded in BL.Optim. To meet industrial requirements in solving the real-world cases with significant dimension, we opted for the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solution generation. Solutions generated by BL.Optim for HHCRSP are competitive against the manual scheduling result, with less 28% less assigned caregivers to perform required 142 services per day by respecting all the specified constraints.']",2022/07/03,['Florent Mouysset'],"['Cluster 11', 'Cluster 11', 'Cluster 20', 'Cluster 3', 'Cluster 19', 'Cluster 11']",Cluster 11

The ability to consider risks is essential to maintain business performance. In addition, integrating the different business departments’ visions in a common business vision is necessary to properly plan the future of a company. However, it is still a challenge for companies to design and maintain a decision-making process supporting strategic supply chain decisions that integrates risk management and unify business vision across departments. This paper relates an industrial experiment as an attempt to meet this challenge. This experiment was asked by a pharmaceutical company with the aim of supporting strategic decisions regarding its network of suppliers. It led to a decision-making process including the use of a computerized information system composed of a software for computations and a business intelligence software to easily make decisions. This process was put in practice on a pilot use case with two years old data. It resulted in the identification of several decisions that could have been made if the process was in operation two years ago, which is considered as a first validation of the approach. Finally, limitations have been identified regarding the data collection, opening avenues for future research on an innovative approach combining supply chain hyperconnectivity and event-driven principles.']",2019/09/25,"['Raphaël Oger', 'Matthieu Lauras', 'Frederick Benaben']","['Cluster 8', 'Cluster 2', 'Cluster 2', 'Cluster 8', 'Cluster 14']",Cluster 8
