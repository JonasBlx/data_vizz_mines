There is a growing interest in dealing with uncertainty in real-world decision support and a concrete need to generate knowledge from information, as well as from models relying on that information. Furthermore, theoretical, and technological advances, such as Digital Twins, enable DSSs to better support human decision-making capabilities in the modern digital age. The new business models of this era amplify the demand for a customized and intelligent decision support capable of meeting the needs of modern industry, business, and society.\r\n\r\nThis special issue welcomes articles on methodologies and technologies, as well as application-oriented works addressing decision support challenges.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for submissions is November 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nThis Call for Papers is open to the entire community of academics and practitioners.

9,Towards proactive agility of crisis response,"['Accident management', 'Decision making', 'Emergency plans', 'Hazards', 'Risk assessment']",['Informatique [cs]'],"['The goal of this poster is to introduce the very first steps of a framework to support decision-making during the crisis response step of the crisis lifecycle. Indeed, crisis situations are unstable phenomena by nature and by the effects of the crisis response itself. So, the crisis response is challenged over time: new objectives, new risks, lack of resources, evolving weather conditions, etc. Reacting once events happened to adapt the response is not sufficient enough to provide the agility required by the decision-makers. Based on the projected effects of the chosen crisis response on a real-time model and several anticipated models of the situation, the proposed framework aims to achieve the last step of the situation awareness approach: the projection of the current situation in the near future. This can enable a proactive on-the-fly agility of the crisis response. The presented idea relies on the main results of the previous research work of two research teams on the agility of the crisis response (Barthe-Delanoë et al. 2018) and the transformation of raw data into a Common Operational Picture (COP) in a context of Big Data (Fertier et al. 2018). The aim is to combine these results to achieve the highest level of situational awareness by supporting proactive agility of the crisis response instead of reactive agility.']",2019/05/19,['A.

14,Optimisation models for the design of multiple self-consumption loops in semi-rural areas,"['Optimization and Control (math.OC)', 'FOS: Mathematics']",['Informatique [cs]'],"[""Collective electricity self-consumption gains increasing interest in a context where localised consumption of energy is a lever of sustainable development. While easing energy distribution networks, collective self-consumption requires complementary prosumers' profiles. Before determining the proper energy exchanges happening between these prosumers, one must ensure their compatibility in the context of collective self-consumption. Motivated by real use cases from a solar power producer, this article proposes network flow-based linear models to solve both the design aspect of the problem and the attribution of distribution flows between the involved prosumers. Two main models are proposed, handling (i) single collective self-consumption loop creation and (ii) multiple loop creation. One of the objectives of this work is to provide models that can be applied at a strategic level which implies their extension to large time scale and large spatial scale. To do so, associated Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions are proposed to ensure model scalability along temporal and spatial dimensions. The proposed models are tested on realistic use cases to assess their performances.""]",2024/10/17,['Yohann Chasseray']

These methods offer visibility and comprehension out of complex and unstructured event logs. Over the past decade, the classic heuristic miner and applied heuristic-based process discovery algorithms showed promising results in revealing the hidden process patterns in information systems. One of the challenges related to such algorithms is the arbitrary selection of recorded behaviors in an event log. The offered filtering thresholds are manually adjustable, which could lead to the extraction of a non-optimal process model. This is also visible in commercial process mining solutions. Recently, the first version of the stable heuristic miner algorithm targeted this issue by evaluating the statistical stability of an event log. However, the previous version was limited to evaluating only activities’ behaviors. In this article, we’ll be evaluating the statistical stability of both activities and edges of a graph, which could be discovered from an event log. As a contribution, the stable heuristic miner 2 is introduced. Consequently, the definition of the descriptive reference process model has improved. The novel algorithm is evaluated by using two real-world event logs. These event logs are the familiar Sepsis data set and the urology department patients’ pathways event log, which is recorded by monitoring the interpreted location data of patients on hospital premises and is shared with the scientific community in this article.']",2024,"['Franck Fontanili', 'Elyes Lamine', 'Frederick Benaben']"

In such cases, when the offer definition relies simply on key design choices without a detailed design, there is a specific risk (ETO-specific risk) that customer expectations cannot be fulfilled. This kind of risk is in addition to the conventional risks (non ETO-specific risk) involved in any delivery process (machine break down, resource not available, scrapped part…). In order to minimize the supplier risk of not being able to complete the offer as accepted and contracted by the customer, a knowledge-based system can be used to assist risk engineering. Consequently, this article proposes two interrelated knowledge modeling contributions. Firstly, a risk knowledge model which, when implemented in a knowledge-based system that supports risk characterization and risk treatment by using knowledge re-use techniques, is proposed and discussed. Secondly, two knowledge typologies for risk characterizations and treatments (both for ETO and non-ETO situations) in order to support risk knowledge, identification and modeling are also proposed and discussed.

The study is performed for a general periodic undulated bottom of moderate steepness that is long compared to the film thickness, followed by a case study over the sinusoidal bottom. The long-wave instabilities of the ununiform film are used by deriving a nonlinear evolution equation in the classical long-wave expansion method framework. The one-equation model can track the free surface evolution and involve the bottom undulation, viscosity, gravity, surface tension, and phase change (evaporation/condensation) effects. Linear stability analysis shows that the bottom steepness ζ has a dual role. In the downhill region, increasing ζ destabilizes, whereas increasing ζ stabilizes in the uphill region. Weakly nonlinear waves are studied using the method of multiple scales to obtain the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. The results show that both supercritical and subcritical solutions are possible for evaporating and condensate film. Interestingly, while one subcritical region is visible for an evaporating film, two subcritical unstable regions are found for condensate film. The numerical solution of the free-surface equation demonstrates the finite-amplitude behavior that tends to dry out for an evaporating film. For condensate film, the thickness increases rapidly. The rupture dynamics highly depend on the initial perturbation, and the bottom steepness has a negligible effect on it. Kutateladze number has a significant impact on the stability characteristic of the film flow as it represents a sort of efficiency of phase change that occurs at the interface.']",2022,['Nicolas Cellier']

Though humanitarian organizations have during the last decades made considerable efforts to improve the response to crises in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, HSCs are still faced with so many challenges, one of which is the incorporation of sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in the management of their supply chains. In the literature, some authors have highlighted that the planning and achievement of sustainability performance objectives in humanitarian operations is hindered by the lack of decision support systems (DSS). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective Master Planning DSS for managing sustainable HSCs. This Master Planning DSS includes: (1) the definition of a set of metrics for measuring the performance of a sustainable HSC; (2) an algorithm to solve the multi-objective problem; and (3) a Master Planning mathematical model to support the tactical planning of the sustainable HSC. Using the information gathered from field research and the literature, an illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the implementation and utility of the proposed DSS. The results show that the order in which the three sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) are prioritized has some impact on the performance measures. Therefore, it is important to fix a tolerance that would enable to obtain an acceptable balance (trade-off) between the three sustainability objectives, in line with the prioritization choice of the decision maker.']",2019,"['Laura Laguna Salvado', 'Matthieu Lauras']"

However, the characterization and classification of GIs are challenging due to their relatively small size and considerable genetic diversity. Predicting their intercellular mobility is of utmost importance in the context of the emerging crisis of multidrug resistance. Here, we propose a large-scale classification method to categorize GIs according to their mobility profile and, subsequently, analyze their gene cargo. We based our classification decision scheme on a collection of mobility protein motif definitions available in publicly accessible databases. Our results show that the size distribution of GI classes correlates with their respective structure and complexity. Self-transmissible GIs are usually the largest, except in Bacillota and Actinomycetota, accumulate antibiotic and phage resistance genes, and favour the use of a tyrosine recombinase to insert into a host's replicon. Non-mobilizable GIs tend to use a DDE transposase instead. Finally, although tRNA genes are more frequently targeted as insertion sites by GIs encoding a tyrosine recombinase, most GIs insert in a protein-encoding gene. This study is a stepping stone toward a better characterization of mobile GIs in bacterial genomes and their mechanism of mobility.""]",2023,['Nicolas Cellier']

To achieve this goal, this paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting a model that incorporates the two issues in the integrated planning system: (1) the procurement commitment objective is met through the just-in-time delivery of non-renewable resources to the project sites while considering the limited supply capacity of suppliers, and (2) the environmental commitment is satisfied by collecting and recycling the waste generated at project sites.

The extraction of these pathways provides more transparency about patient activities. The previous versions of this algorithm receive an event log and discover several process models by using manually adjustable thresholds. Then, the expert is left with the difficult task of deciding which discovered model can serve as the descriptive reference process model. Such a decision is completely arbitrary and it has been seen as a major structural issue in the literature of process mining. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a new process discovery algorithm to facilitate patient pathways diagnosis.\r\nApproach:To address this scientific challenge, this paper proposes to consider the statistical stability phenomenon in an event log, and it introduces the stable heuristic miner algorithm as its contribution. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, a case study has been presented to monitor patient pathways in a medical consultation platform.\r\nOriginality:Thanks to this algorithm, the value of thresholds will be automatically calculated at the statistically stable limits. Hence, instead of several models, only one process model will be discovered. To the best of our knowledge, applying the statistical stability phenomenon in the context of process mining to discover a reference process model from location event logs has not been addressed before.\r\nFindings: Practical implications-The results enabled to remove the uncertainty to determine the threshold that represents the common patient pathways and consequently, leaving some room for potential diagnosis of the pathways.']",2022,"['Sina Namaki Araghi', 'Franck Fontanili', 'Elyes Lamine', 'Frederick Benaben']"

The proposed framework combines automated domain-independent rule-based extraction for unsupervised relation extraction and semantic-oriented machine learning techniques for knowledge base enrichment. In the engineering field, another contribution resides in the generic aspect of the framework, leading to the possibility to populate ontologies and automatically build knowledge bases in various domains.

Changing these inputs can be done without affecting the performance of the rule-based extraction, which is around 60% in terms of precision. Three different matching methods are also presented.

The main novelty of flsgen is the decomposition of landscape generation into two steps: the solving of a constraint satisfaction problem and the generation of a landscape raster with a stochastic algorithm. The latter relies on a continuous environmental gradient that influences the landscape’s spatial configuration. 3. flsgen can generate fine-grained artificial landscapes in small amounts of time, which makes it suited to produce large landscape series systematically.

In such cases, when the offer definition relies simply on key design choices without a detailed design, there is a specific risk (ETO-specific risk) that customer expectations cannot be fulfilled. This kind of risk is in addition to the conventional risks (non ETO-specific risk) involved in any delivery process (machine break down, resource not available, scrapped part…). In order to minimize the supplier risk of not being able to complete the offer as accepted and contracted by the customer, a knowledge-based system can be used to assist risk engineering. Consequently, this article proposes two interrelated knowledge modeling contributions. Firstly, a risk knowledge model which, when implemented in a knowledge-based system that supports risk characterization and risk treatment by using knowledge re-use techniques, is proposed and discussed. Secondly, two knowledge typologies for risk characterizations and treatments (both for ETO and non-ETO situations) in order to support risk knowledge, identification and modeling are also proposed and discussed. These contributions are innovative and groundbreaking in terms of both academics and applications: they provide a formal model to structure risk knowledge and a first list of risks and treatments to be taken into account in ETO and non ETO situations.

The study is performed for a general periodic undulated bottom of moderate steepness that is long compared to the film thickness, followed by a case study over the sinusoidal bottom. The long-wave instabilities of the ununiform film are used by deriving a nonlinear evolution equation in the classical long-wave expansion method framework. The one-equation model can track the free surface evolution and involve the bottom undulation, viscosity, gravity, surface tension, and phase change (evaporation/condensation) effects. Linear stability analysis shows that the bottom steepness ζ has a dual role. In the downhill region, increasing ζ destabilizes, whereas increasing ζ stabilizes in the uphill region. Weakly nonlinear waves are studied using the method of multiple scales to obtain the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. The results show that both supercritical and subcritical solutions are possible for evaporating and condensate film. Interestingly, while one subcritical region is visible for an evaporating film, two subcritical unstable regions are found for condensate film. The numerical solution of the free-surface equation demonstrates the finite-amplitude behavior that tends to dry out for an evaporating film. For condensate film, the thickness increases rapidly. The rupture dynamics highly depend on the initial perturbation, and the bottom steepness has a negligible effect on it. Kutateladze number has a significant impact on the stability characteristic of the film flow as it represents a sort of efficiency of phase change that occurs at the interface.']",2022,['Nicolas Cellier']

Though humanitarian organizations have during the last decades made considerable efforts to improve the response to crises in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, HSCs are still faced with so many challenges, one of which is the incorporation of sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in the management of their supply chains. In the literature, some authors have highlighted that the planning and achievement of sustainability performance objectives in humanitarian operations is hindered by the lack of decision support systems (DSS). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective Master Planning DSS for managing sustainable HSCs. This Master Planning DSS includes: (1) the definition of a set of metrics for measuring the performance of a sustainable HSC; (2) an algorithm to solve the multi-objective problem; and (3) a Master Planning mathematical model to support the tactical planning of the sustainable HSC. Using the information gathered from field research and the literature, an illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the implementation and utility of the proposed DSS. The results show that the order in which the three sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) are prioritized has some impact on the performance measures. Therefore, it is important to fix a tolerance that would enable to obtain an acceptable balance (trade-off) between the three sustainability objectives, in line with the prioritization choice of the decision maker.']",2019,"['Laura Laguna Salvado', 'Matthieu Lauras']"

These challenges include environmental commitments and constraints related to the procurement of resources (as regards procurement commitment).

To achieve this goal, this paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting a model that incorporates the two issues in the integrated planning system: (1) the procurement commitment objective is met through the just-in-time delivery of non-renewable resources to the project sites while considering the limited supply capacity of suppliers, and (2) the environmental commitment is satisfied by collecting and recycling the waste generated at project sites. A mixed-integer linear formulation of the problem is proposed. Since the model is NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial time-hard), the paper develops a new heuristic-based genetic algorithm to solve the problem instances. The main parameters of the algorithm are tuned using the Taguchi method. The results show the efficiency of the algorithm in obtaining appropriate solutions in reasonable computational times. The integrated planning model that is proposed in this paper and its novel resolution method would help managers to make more responsive and efficient decisions.']",2021,['Jacques Lamothe']

However, the characterization and classification of GIs are challenging due to their relatively small size and considerable genetic diversity. Predicting their intercellular mobility is of utmost importance in the context of the emerging crisis of multidrug resistance. Here, we propose a large-scale classification method to categorize GIs according to their mobility profile and, subsequently, analyze their gene cargo. We based our classification decision scheme on a collection of mobility protein motif definitions available in publicly accessible databases. Our results show that the size distribution of GI classes correlates with their respective structure and complexity. Self-transmissible GIs are usually the largest, except in Bacillota and Actinomycetota, accumulate antibiotic and phage resistance genes, and favour the use of a tyrosine recombinase to insert into a host's replicon. Non-mobilizable GIs tend to use a DDE transposase instead. Finally, although tRNA genes are more frequently targeted as insertion sites by GIs encoding a tyrosine recombinase, most GIs insert in a protein-encoding gene. This study is a stepping stone toward a better characterization of mobile GIs in bacterial genomes and their mechanism of mobility.""]",2023,['Nicolas Cellier']

Airlines are looking to reduce aircraft unavailability. Optimizing maintenance is a perspective to increase the operational potential of aircraft and offers novel managerial implications. Maintenance tasks are traditionally organized in periodic blocks of activities. In the modern aviation, more and more maintenance jobs can be performed between two flights, which is called Line Maintenance Scheduling Problem (LMSP). The expected goal of our paper is to propose an operational schedule that can be directly executed by maintainers, i.e. assigning a start time to each elementary activity and a resource to perform it. This new problem is named Operational Aircraft Line Maintenance Scheduling Problem (OALMSP). A scheduling assistant could help airlines to reduce maintenance costs and resource management. Planners have to respect task deadlines imposed by regulations, precedence constraints between certain operations and also ensure the availability of resources in order to perform specific actions. This problem is an extension of a Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). In this article, we propose an industrial application of an automatic aircraft line maintenance scheduler based on a Constraint Programming (CP) model. The flexibility of our approach means we can easily adapt to airline use cases without changing the properties of the model. The optimization problem is generally made up of several objectives ordered according to their importance. The objectives are respectively to plan as many tasks as possible according to their priority, then to minimize both the use of resources and the deviation time between scheduled dates and target dates of tasks. The lexicographical order enables the use of human reasoning and the management of business priorities.

For the past decade, research around DDMRP has been focused on proving and advancing the methodology in different industrial environments, while neglecting its parametrization. Indeed, the authors suggested general rules to set the DDOM’s key parameters, yet no learning approach has been developed to set them. This present paper is the first that proposes to use machine learning to parametrize a DDOM facing unknown demand, and particularly to adjust dynamically the order spike threshold and the order spike horizon. A reinforcement learning algorithm with three different reward functions is coupled to a DDMRP flowshop simulation model facing an atypical demand including spikes. Besides studying the learning ability of the algorithm, we evaluate the performance of the model which is compared to a DDOM without parameter adjustment. The analysis shows that it is possible to drive the order spike thresholds to increase the performance of the production system, regarding customer satisfaction and stock level optimization.

For instance, a local event, occurring in a CI (e.g., an accident), can propagate throughout these interactions, impacting other CI, leading to a higher intensity and to a global impact. Classical risks analysis is limited in terms of global and dynamic vision of these CI, to manage these events efficiently and to recover to an acceptable functioning state for the end users.

Furthermore, other concerns like counterfeiting as well as bad headline pressures in case of a product recall, urge firms to develop their trace- ability systems which currently show fragilities.

Particularly, Critical Infrastructures (CI - e.g., water distribution, health care) that support the daily life of societies are impacted by these disasters. These CI are indeed essential. By their various interactions and links, they become more fragile when facing complex situations. For instance, a local event, occurring in a CI (e.g., an accident), can propagate throughout these interactions, impacting other CI, leading to a higher intensity and to a global impact. Classical risks analysis is limited in terms of global and dynamic vision of these CI, to manage these events efficiently and to recover to an acceptable functioning state for the end users. To this purpose, resilience is a useful concept, highlighted by numerous research works and organizations to characterize the best way a CI has to react to an undesirable event and avoid, if possible, its propagation. The purpose of this paper is to present the main principles of a methodology to assess and analyze resilience of a CI based on a multi views and systemic model formalized as a digital twin.

However, accessible information about items origins or content does not meet consumers, associations and regulatory services growing expectations. Furthermore, other concerns like counterfeiting as well as bad headline pressures in case of a product recall, urge firms to develop their trace- ability systems which currently show fragilities. Indeed, today, companies manage traceability in their way which creates silos. Consequently, information flow is slowed and limited along the chain. Based on these, the study discusses the concept of ag- gregating different companies traceability management systems into a single one covering all the supply chain. The concept implementation is made possible through collaborative platforms like the Blockchain. In terms of traceability, this technology presents interests in recording transactions in a transparent, reliable and secure ways. However, it first requires data to be structured before makes it concrete. The contribution of this paper is to provide a meta model as a first groundwork for a possible Blockchain implementation for supply chain traceability purposes.

Indeed, all decisions made within a company are generally aimed at maximizing the company’s value. In accounting, almost all models for assessing the value of a company are related to the amount of cash the company is able to generate. As a result, maximizing the value of a firm is usually about maximizing cash flow. However, beyond the usual accounting models, several recent initiatives have highlighted the key role of managing all assets, and not only the ones considered by the general accountability, in decision making and cash generation. Unfortunately, these methods are currently limited to conceptual and qualitative proposals that do not lead to a real decision support system thus far. This paper proposes a first step of formalization aiming at providing tools for these asset-oriented decision support approaches. The contribution is a Causal Loop Diagram to Support Decision-Making in order to maximize the value of companies. Based on a dedicated literature review, we design an asset-based causal loop model that formalizes the qualitative results of the literature review. We then develop an instantiation on an illustrative case via simulation in order to verify the relevance of the proposal and to show how such a model can be used in practice for decision making. This will support next research to develop an asset-based decision support system to maximize value of companies.']",2023/05/30,"['Romain Ben Taleb', 'Matthieu Lauras', 'Aurelie Montarnal']"

Then, the problem consists in determining the boundary conditions necessary for the allocation of medications to the different compartments without similar/incompatible medications in close proximity to one another.

The main aim of this paper is to develop an automated approach for extracting and classifying gene-disease associations from relevant literature research papers using both natural language processing and machine learning techniques. This paper extracted data from free-text literature research papers and built four different dataset formats to discover an optimal representation. Machine and Deep learning models (NB, KNN, SVM, NN, CNN, and LSTM) with TF-IDF were applied on the built datasets. As a result, the format of the dataset with (Positive and Negative) instances only, was found to be the best representation for extracting gene-disease associations with optimal accuracy between 74% and 91%. For the four dataset representations, Multilayer Neural Networks was able to predict all classes in most experiments with accuracy between 64% and 91%. From the initial results, this work highlights the need for additional work to improve both the performance of these models and the data extraction method to build more accurate and optimal dataset representation.']",2022/12/05,['Elyes Lamine']

In this article, a new and original vision of risks and opportunities management is introduced and discussed in the context of a simple example. The main expected benefit is to enable decision makers to manage the trajectory of a considered system with regards to its performance towards its associated objectives, and to also support the definition of these performance objectives. The system could be an enterprise in an economic context but mainly any social system trying to avoid or manage instability, disruptions or crises.']",2019/09/25,"['Frederick Benaben', 'Matthieu Lauras']"

Such an explicit review could improve the conception, construction, and utilization of DT in environments that are both dynamic and stochastic.

Societal issues include effectively managing unexpected changes and ensuring employee engagement during process modifications. The former category involves the limitations of technology when introducing process changes while Agile BPM and Social BPM concepts have been explored in previous studies to tackle the latter. These investigations have resulted in the development of a Social-Media (SM) based BPM platform and an agility framework. The SM platform draws inspiration from popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Its primary objective is to merge the design-time and run-time phases of the business process (BP) lifecycle as well as to actively engage stakeholders in the dynamic design and implementation of BPs. By simplifying the response to potential changes and maintaining stakeholder involvement throughout the process, the platform addresses the aforementioned challenges. This article establishes a correlation between SM platform concepts and BPM concepts, emphasizing how they facilitate the concurrent design and execution of BPs. Furthermore, the article demonstrates the application of the SM platform in implementing the agility framework through a use case analysis involving a scientific paper submission process. To overcome the current emphasis on stakeholder involvement and human capabilities in applying the platform, we finally explore the possibilities of employing AI agents as automated assistants. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.']",2023/09/11,"['Mehran Majidian Eidgahi', 'Anne-Marie Barthe-Delanoë', 'Frederick Benaben']"

We provide preliminary experimental results contrasting the baseline shaped by the current HSC structures, behaviors and practices, notably relative to sourcing, transporting, and warehousing, with those of hyperconnected HSCs in line with the Physical Internet at distinct degrees of maturity. In the experiment, we study past disaster scenarios that occurred in Indonesia and response efforts under different behaviors simulated with this platform. Initial results show that PI concepts are smoothly fitted to HSCs and the performance of hyperconnected HSCs is better than the current baseline.']",2021/06/14,['Manon Grest']

Transformation towards hyperconnected humanitarian supply chains is one of the most promising paths and the Physical Internet could provide a paradigm for this evolution. However, the impact of this shift on the humanitarian supply chain's performance, particularly readiness, has been understudied. To address this issue, a simulation-based assessment of hyperconnected humanitarian supply chains' response readiness is conducted. Different combinations of multiple potentials of the Physical Internet are simulated, and the corresponding effects on relief operations are analyzed.

The flooded area as a system has components of (i) the flood (e.g. time of onset, magnitude, intensity, etc.), (ii) the area (e.g. geographical features, temporary perimeter barriers, dam, diversion canals), and (iii) the community (e.g. reaction time, emergency strain, evacuation delay).
